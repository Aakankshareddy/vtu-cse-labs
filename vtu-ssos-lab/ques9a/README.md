Problem Statement
=================

Shell script that accepts file names as arguments and creates a shell script that contains this file as well as the code
to recreate these files. Thus if the script generated by your script is executed it would recreate the orginal files.

### Compilation

```

$ sh ques9a.sh test_script_1.sh test_script_2.sh

```
